# BookBot 07 Roadmap & Backlog

This document tracks the evolution of the BookBot Narrative Engine, bridging the gap between foundational design and active development.

## User Journey: The Vision
**The Goal**: Empower a solo author to move from "Spark to Manuscript" in a weekend.

1. **Spark**: The author enters a premise ("A lighthouse keeper discovers the light is powered by captured memories").
2. **Phase 1 (Brainstorming)**: The **01a_architect** and **01b_devils_advocate** debate the premise, suggesting the lighthouse is actually a prison for forgotten gods.
3. **Phase 2 (Structuring)**: The **02a_skeleton_plotter** generates 20 chapters, ensuring the mystery unravels at the right pace.
4. **Phase 3 (World Building)**: The **03a_librarian** populates the "World Bible" with character details and lore artifacts.
5. **Phase 4 (Drafting)**: The **04ab-e_drafting_fleet** generates prose using the 3-step system.
6. **Phase 5 (Audit & Polish)**: The **05ab_audit_shadow** flags consistency gaps and tracks unspoken subtext.
7. **Phase 6 (Export)**: The author reviews the full manuscript and exports it to Markdown.
